# CMPE 103 OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
```
LAB EXERCISE No. 8 – TV
```

## Task Instruction:
Create a Python Code for creating the Class named TV and a Test Driver program named TestTV that will create two objects from Class TV and will produce the following output:
* tv1's channel is 30 and volume level is 3
* tv2's channel is 3 and volume level is 2

### Modules Used
Kindly install the following module for the program to work properly.
* colorama

### There are 2 python files in this repository:
* First is the **ClassTv.py** that contains the class TV, its attributes, and methods; and 
* The **TestTV.py** file that calls the methods of ClassTv.py file in order to produce the desired given output. 

### How this program works
Among the 2 existing files, You will only execute the TestTV.py file in the terminal. When you execute the TestTV program, two prompts asking for your preferred channel and volume level will appear.  Once you've entered your own values in the editable section, the program will use the functions in ClassTV.py and print the outcome.
